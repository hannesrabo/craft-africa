				h2 Cleaning water for the environment
				p Imagine to get rid of the plastic bottles carrying drinking water. In our concept our chemical free water purifying system creates great tasting clean water on tap. Branded glass bottles to be filled, sealed, used and refilled are delivered with the system together with a cap sealing unit. No more need to serve your guests with water in plastic bottles!

				h2 Harvesting power from the sun
				p Energy consumption is an important factor when producing beer. By including solar panels we are able to harvest and convert solar energy to power the cooling needed to keep the quality of the beer at a high level. At this stage we are not able to generate enough power to cover all the energy needs for the beer-making process, but the containers are ready to be upgraded for future battery options.

				h2 Empowering individuals
				p Many of the craft beer initiatives around the world are started by enthusiastic beer-loving entrepreneurs. The local production of craft beer generates job opportunities as well as tax income for the communities. Our ambition is to work for the empowerment of entrepreneurs, so that they can build their markets and their own local brands, thanks to our high-quality technology and financial solutions.
